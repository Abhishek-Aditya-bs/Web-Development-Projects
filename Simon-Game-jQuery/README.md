## Game Description 

Simon is a game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. The Game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.

## How to Play

The Game has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed . A round in the game consists of the screen lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
